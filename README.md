# Hi, I'm Umar

I am a full stack developer who works across mobile, backend and web technologies. I focus on building applications that are reliable, easy to maintain and simple for users to interact with. Most of my work is for clients and kept in private repositories, but this overview reflects the tools I use regularly.

## Mobile App Development

I build high quality mobile applications for iOS and Android. This includes cross-platform work and native development when needed. I handle UI development, app logic, API integration, authentication, performance and deployment.

I also work with Firebase App Distribution for internal testing.

## Backend Development

I build backend services with Python and FastAPI, and use Node.js and Express when a JavaScript-based solution fits better. My work includes authentication, data processing, payment systems, business logic and external integrations.

## AI Tools

I use AI tools in projects where automation, text processing or image based features are required. This includes API based models, speech tools and lightweight machine learning components.

Most of my client projects are private, so public activity does not represent the full scope of my work.
