# Hi, I'm Umar

I am a full stack developer who works across mobile, backend and web technologies. I focus on building applications that are reliable, easy to maintain and simple for users to interact with. Most of my work is for clients and lives in private repositories, but this profile shows the tools I use regularly.

## Mobile App Development

I build high quality mobile applications for iOS and Android. This includes cross-platform development and native development when a project requires it. My work covers UI, state management, app logic, API integration, authentication and deployment pipelines.

## Backend Development

I work with Python and FastAPI for building APIs and backend services. I also use Node.js and Express for JavaScript based projects. My experience includes authentication, payments, automation, data handling and integrations with external services.

Most of my client work is kept in private repositories, so public activity does not fully represent the range of projects I work on.
